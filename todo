- Better caching
  - Cache control headers in middleware
  - Base cache busting query string on directory mtimes so there are less lookups (assuming this isn't just an OSX thing)

- Rails generator for new features

- Improve TestCase class
  - Support in stubs_http_request for specifying feature names to be initalised (i.e. set the X-JavascriptFeatures-Init header without explicitly naming it)
  - attr_accessors for the HTML, Harmony page etc.
  - Helper methods to trigger actions, like clicking on buttons
  - Assertions for leaving the page (by GET or POST)
